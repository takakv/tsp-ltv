# Changelog


## 0.3.0 [2026-06-27]

Chain-validation hardening: AIA SSRF guard, critical-extension rejection, leaf
purpose binding, RFC 5280 name constraints, delegated-OCSP-responder checking,
and fail-closed trust-anchor loading. See `docs/adr/0015-chain-validation-hardening.md`.

### Breaking Changes

#### `from_pem_directory` now fails closed on a malformed anchor

`TrustStore::from_pem_directory` previously did a best-effort load, silently
skipping any file it could not read or parse — which shrinks the trust-anchor
set without the operator noticing. It now returns `Err` on the first
unreadable/unparseable candidate (or directory-entry I/O error), naming the
offending file. Callers that want the old best-effort behaviour must switch to
the new `from_pem_directory_lenient`, which returns `(store, skipped)` and
reports — never silently drops — the skipped files.

#### New `TrustError::ProfileViolation` variant

RFC 5280 certificate-profile / path-validation failures — `basicConstraints` /
`keyUsage`, `pathLenConstraint`, an unrecognized critical extension, a name
constraint, or leaf purpose binding — now return `TrustError::ProfileViolation`
("certificate profile violation: …") instead of `TrustError::SignatureVerification`
("signature verification failed: …"), which was misleading. Genuine
cryptographic signature failures still return `SignatureVerification`. Code that
matched `SignatureVerification` for these profile checks — or that matches
`TrustError` exhaustively — must be updated.

### Added

#### Shared SSRF guard (`crate::net`)

The SSRF controls originally embedded in the CRL fetch path are extracted into a
new `net` module so the CRL and AIA paths share one audited implementation:

- `validate_fetch_url` — `http`/`https` scheme allowlist **and** resolved-IP
  filtering (loopback, private, link-local/metadata, unique-local, multicast,
  CGNAT, and the other non-globally-routable blocks), run before any egress.
- `hardened_http_client` — a `reqwest::Client` with a bounded redirect policy
  that refuses redirects to literal non-public addresses.
- `is_disallowed_ip` — the address classifier shared by both.

#### AIA chain-builder SSRF guard

`ChainBuilder::fetch_certificate` now validates each attacker-influenced
`caIssuers` URL through `crate::net` before egress and caps the response body at
1 MiB, matching the CRL fetch path.

#### Critical-extension rejection (RFC 5280 §4.2)

`verify_chain` now rejects any certificate (leaf, intermediate, or anchor) that
asserts a *critical* extension whose OID it cannot process. Extensions processed
only under the `ltv` feature (`subjectAltName`, `cRLDistributionPoints`,
`authorityInfoAccess`, `nameConstraints`) are recognised only in that build, so a
tsp-only build keeps such a critical extension fail-closed.

#### Leaf purpose binding

`TrustStore::verify_chain_for_purpose(chain, time, purpose: CertRole)` binds the
leaf to its expected role (EKU / keyUsage), closing a purpose-confusion
fail-open. The existing `verify_chain` signature is unchanged (it delegates with
no leaf purpose), so external callers are unaffected.

#### RFC 5280 name constraints (`ltv::name_constraints`)

A processor for `NameConstraints` (`2.5.29.30`) covering the common GeneralName
types — dNSName, rfc822Name, iPAddress (CIDR), and directoryName (RDN-prefix) —
enforcing permitted/excluded subtrees accumulated top-down from the anchor. A
constraint over an unsupported GeneralName type is rejected as unsupported —
fail closed, never silently ignored.

#### OCSP delegated-responder hardening

`validate_responder_trust` binds the responder certificate to the response's
`responderID` (byName subject / byKeyHash SHA-1). The new
`check_revocation_detailed` → `OcspCheckOutcome` surfaces a delegated responder
that lacks `id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck`; the orchestrator then checks that responder's
own revocation status (bounded by `max_ocsp_recursion`) and fails closed if it
is revoked or cannot be confirmed unrevoked.

#### Trust-anchor directory loading

- `from_pem_directory_lenient` returns `(store, skipped)` for explicit
  best-effort loading, reporting the skipped files and reasons.
- Both directory loaders accept PEM (one or more certificates) **or** a single
  DER-encoded certificate, since `.crt`/`.cer` anchors are commonly raw DER.

### Changed

- The IPv4 SSRF deny-list mirrors `Ipv4Addr::is_global` (which is still
  nightly-only) instead of a hand-maintained subset, adding the previously
  missed non-routable blocks: `0.0.0.0/8`, `192.0.0.0/24`, `198.18.0.0/15`, and
  `240.0.0.0/4`.
- The SSRF guard's DNS resolution is bounded by the same timeout as the HTTP
  request in `TsaClient::timestamp`, `OcspClient::send_ocsp_request`, and
  `ChainBuilder::fetch_certificate`, so a slow/blocked resolver cannot hang past
  the configured timeout.
- `UrlGuardError` wrapping no longer double-prefixes error messages (e.g. the
  OCSP/CRL/TSA path now reads "URL rejected: …" rather than "OCSP error:
  OCSP …"), and the non-public-address wording is no longer duplicated.

### Fixed

- `GeneralSubtree.minimum`/`maximum` are now enforced (RFC 5280 §4.2.1.10
  requires `minimum` to be 0 and `maximum` absent); a constraint encoding a
  non-zero minimum or any maximum is rejected instead of being silently ignored.
- A malformed-length `iPAddress` subjectAltName entry is rejected rather than
  skipped, so iPAddress constraints cannot be bypassed with an invalid SAN.
- PEM-vs-DER anchor detection checks for the `-----BEGIN` armor at the start of
  the file (after optional whitespace) instead of a substring scan, so a DER
  certificate containing those bytes inside an ASN.1 string is not misclassified.
- Trust-anchor file read failures are reported as `TrustError::Io` (preserving
  the path and `ErrorKind`) rather than `CertificateParse`, and re-wrapped parse
  errors are no longer double-prefixed.

## 0.2.0

Initial release: RFC 3161 timestamping client (`tsp`) and long-term validation
(`ltv`) — OCSP/CRL/chain building — over the RustCrypto `cms` / `x509-cert`
stack, with fail-closed revocation, OCSP/CRL freshness, weak-algorithm
rejection, pathLenConstraint enforcement, intermediate-CA extension validation,
algorithm-identifier binding, and SSRF-hardened CRL fetching. See
`docs/adr/0001`–`0014`.
